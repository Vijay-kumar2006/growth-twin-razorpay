## [1.1.4] - 2026-08-30

### Added
* **Live Razorpay Hosted Payment Links:**
  - Integrated with Razorpay's `/v1/payment_links` API to generate real, clickable checkout short URLs (`https://rzp.io/rzp/...`) that open the live Razorpay payment overlay with cards, netbanking, and UPI QR codes.

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
* **Pluggable Storefront Guardrail Evaluation:**
  - Updated `GuardrailEngine` to properly validate product IDs and stock levels from live Shopify Storefront and WooCommerce APIs without restricting lookups to the demo catalog.
  - Test suites now dynamically evaluate against baseline fixtures while testing active store catalog contract resolution.

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
* **Accurate Status Command SKU Count Display:**
  - Fixed `DemoCatalogProvider` to return all products when query is empty/wildcard.
  - `npx razoragent status` now accurately displays `32 product(s) indexed`.
* **Permissive AI Agent Robots Policy:**
  - Added `public/robots.txt` and `app/robots.ts` explicitly allowing AI crawlers and MCP clients on `/` and `/api/razoragent/mcp`.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
* **Strict Error Handling in `npx razoragent connect` Wizard:**
  - Added `CatalogConnectionError` across `ShopifyCatalogProvider` and `WooCommerceCatalogProvider`.
  - Fixed false-positive "Connected, 0 products returned" on HTTP 401/403/404 errors when invalid credentials are provided.
  - Wizard now halts with clear failure message and non-zero exit code, refusing to save invalid credentials to `.env.local`.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
* **Pluggable Catalog Architecture (`CatalogProvider` Contract):**
  - Abstracted catalog data access behind a 3-method asynchronous interface (`searchProducts`, `getProductDetails`, `getProviderName`).
  - Allows Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and custom merchant databases to connect to RazorAgent seamlessly.
* **Production Shopify Storefront API Adapter (`ShopifyCatalogProvider`):**
  - Direct GraphQL integration against `/api/2024-01/graphql.json` using `SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
  - Maps Shopify variants, prices, images, and inventory into RazorAgent's bounded quoting engine.
* **Production WooCommerce REST API Adapter (`WooCommerceCatalogProvider`):**
  - Direct REST v3 integration against `/wp-json/wc/v3/products` using Consumer Key and Secret.
* **Interactive Merchant Onboarding Wizard (`npx razoragent connect`):**
  - Step-by-step CLI setup wizard that validates storefront credentials against live store APIs and saves configuration to `.env.local`.
* **Gateway Status Command (`npx razoragent status`):**
  - Inspects active catalog provider, SKU index count, spend caps, and Razorpay API connection mode.
* **Web Onboarding Wizard (`/connect` and Modal):**
  - 3-step visual onboarding page with live product discovery previews and session-scoped testing.
* **Honest Catalog Source Labeling:**
  - Clear `🟢 LIVE CATALOG (your-store.myshopify.com)` vs `🟡 DEMO CATALOG (sample data)` indicators in both CLI outputs and Web UI headers.
* **Pluggable Catalog Verification Suite (`TEST_06_PLUGGABLE_CATALOG`):**
  - Automated contract and resolution testing for catalog providers.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
* **Compiled TypeScript Module Output:**
  - Added scoped `tsconfig.build.json` compiling `lib/razoragent/*.ts` into CommonJS and `.d.ts` declaration maps in `dist/`.
  - Fixed `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING` when importing `razoragent` in standard Node.js applications.
* **Category-Aware Search Relevance:**
  - Added primary entity disambiguation to prevent cross-category false positives (e.g. Desk Mats returning for "wireless mouse", or Laptop Stands returning for "laptop").
  - Expanded catalog to 28+ varied products across 7 categories.
* **Zero-Dependency Published Package:**
  - Cleaned runtime dependencies (`dependencies: {}`), moving Next.js/React to `devDependencies`.
  - 0 npm audit vulnerabilities.
* **GitHub Actions CI:**
  - Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running builds and verification suites on Node.js 18.x and 20.x.
* **Git Hygiene:**
  - Removed committed tarballs from source control, added `*.tgz` to `.gitignore`, and added `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
